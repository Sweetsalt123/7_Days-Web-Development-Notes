<li> Dhamma Chakra Stupa</li>
Also known as Deeksha Bhumi, the stupa is a marvelous architectural body and can accommodate more than 5,000 people. It is built out of Dhaulpur sandstone, marbles & granites and is 120 feet in height.

<li> Zero Mile </li>

Made using a pillar, four stucco horses and small stone, this place apparently mark as the center of India geographically. However, there is not enough evidence or document supporting this fact.

<li> Drogen palace </li>
About 20 kilometers from the city of Nagpur is a place called Kampee where this Buddhist temple attracts tourists every year. Here, devotees are often seen chanting Buddhist prayers and meditating for hours and hours at stretch.
The temple has proven to be a great city escape during the summers for Nagpurians when the scorching heat can become a little too unbearable. A drive or two-wheeler ride early in the morning is the best way to travel and make the most of overall experience to this getaway.
